										Accuracy refers to a performance metric that measures the model's ability to correctly classify instances within 
										a given dataset. It is calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances 
										in the dataset. In other words, accuracy provides an indication of the model's overall correctness in making predictions.

									<p style="color: white;">
										Validation is a technique to evaluate the performance of models during learning. 
										It is done by separating the data set into training and validating sets and then evaluating the performance 
										of the model (deep neural network in this case) on the validation sets.
